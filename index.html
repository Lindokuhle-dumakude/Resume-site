        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a CodeSpace graduate web developer passionate about creating beautiful, functional websites and learning new technologies.
            I thrive in collaborative environments, enjoy problem-solving, and am eager to contribute to real-world projects.
            My goal is to continuously improve my skills, build impactful applications, and eventually work on projects that make a difference in users' lives.
            When I'm not coding, I love learning new things, I enjoy reading and playing video games!
